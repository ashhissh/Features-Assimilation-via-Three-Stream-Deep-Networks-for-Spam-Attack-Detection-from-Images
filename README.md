# Features-Assimilation-via-Three-Stream-Deep-Networks-for-Spam-Attack-Detection-from-Images
Research Paper published in CVIP conference 
Spam filters typically use optical character recognition (OCR)
for extracting the text from images. These days spammers have circumvented optical scanning by fracturing the text within the images thereby
improving their attacks and finally reaching to the users. This paper
proposes a three-stream deep learning-based model which uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Transfer Learning, SIFT and HOG
features via hybrid fusion framework. Transfer learning alone can only
achieve an accuracy of 95% but our hybrid model shows improved performance and obtains an accuracy of 96%, eclipsing the existing techniques. We have created our dataset of challenging HAM images which
will be publicly available. On our challenging dataset as well, the proposed method outperforms other existing methods for effectively detecting the spam attacks targeted via images.
